# Arcade Game

This is a simple recreation of the classic arcade game. The entities in this game are the player and the enemies (bugs).

## Run

Run the game by opening 'index.html' in a Web browser.


## Usage

 The player's goal is to reach the water without hitting any of the enemies. The player can move left, right, up and down using the keyboard arrow keys. Pressing left key moves the player to the left, right key to the right, up key to up and down key to down.

 The enemies(bugs) move in varying speeds on the pavement. If the player collides with an enemy, the game is lost and the player moves back to the initial start location and can play again. Once the player reaches the water the game is won. Then the game is automatically reset and the player is moved back to the initial location.
